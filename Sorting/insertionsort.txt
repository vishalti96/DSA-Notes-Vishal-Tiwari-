Steps
The simple steps of achieving the insertion sort are listed as follows -

Step 1: If the element is the first element, assume that it is already sorted. Return 1.

Step 2: Pick the next element and store it separately in a key.

Step 3: Now, compare the key with all elements in the sorted array.

Step 4: If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, then move to the next element. Else, shift greater elements in the array towards the right.

Step 5: Insert the value.

Step 6: Repeat until the array is sorted.
